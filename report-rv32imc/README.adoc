|=================================================

The RISC-V GCC tool chain was built for the `riscv32-unknown-elf` target for the `rv32imc` architecture.

For comparison an ARM GCC tool chain was built for the `arm-none-eabi` target for the `cortex-m4` target with Thumb 2 instructions and soft floating point.

Both tool chains used the same source tree.

=== Compiled code size

The raw data for all these results can be found in <<raw_data>>

We focus initially on just the size of the code. We look later at read only data, initialized data and uninitialized (BSS) data.

==== Methodology ====

For each benchmark program we use the size program to find the size of text (code), initialized data and uninitialized data (BSS) sections.

We summarize the results by totalling the values in each category.  This has the drawback of causing the summary results to be dominated by large programs. We therefore also record the ARM results in each category as a percentage of the corresponding RISC-V results. We summarize these relative sizes as a percentage.

==== Baseline code size

Results from a straightforward compilation of each benchmark using the following options for RISC-V.

Superficially it would appear that the compiled code for ARM is larger.  However the graph shows that the larger programs are generally smaller for ARM, while it is smaller programs which are relatively large.

An examination of the symbols in one binary shows the problem.  Taking the smallest program (`ns`) we see 43 symbols defined in the binary are as follows.

The ARM code includes a large number of standard C library symbols, while the RISC-V code includes almost none.  The symbols have been pulled in by the standard C start up code.

==== Code size without C runtime startup

We reconfigure to use a dummy C runtime startup function, which just calls main.  This should be the same size for both RISC-V and ARM and should only pull in library functions actually needed by the program.

The compile time options add the option `-nostartfiles` to omit the standard C runtime startup, which is replaced by a dummy version, the change is to configure to use a dummy C run-time for RISC-V. For RISC-V the compiler options are as follows.

We see the ARM and RISC-V figures have become closer.  When we look at the smallest program again (`ns`) we see that the two programs are now almost the same size (72 bytes for RISC-V, compared to 78 bytes for ARM). We see a total of just 12 symbols defined for RISC-V.

No standard C library code has been included.

However, while BEEBS minimizes its use of library functions, it still has some benchmarks which do need the standard C library and for these we see the ARM code is still much bigger.  It seems the ARM newlib library is compiled with several functions per file, so that linking in one function can pull in many more functions.

==== Code size without the standard C library

We reconfigure to use both a dummy C runtime startup function and a dummy standard C library.  This library has functions which either do nothing (if they have a `void` return type) or return constant zero.  They have no dependencies, and because the benchmarks are built using garbage collection of sections only those functions referenced will be included.  This should eliminate all differences that are due to the implementation of the C library.

The compile time options add the option `-nostartfiles` to omit the standard C runtime startup, which is replaced by a dummy version and `-nostdlib`, which omits the standard C library, which is replaced by a dummy version.  This has the effect of also excluding the standard emulation libary (`libgcc`), so we manually add this back on the command line.  For RISC-V the compiler options are as follows.

We now see the ARM code is on average smaller than RISC-V. In particular the maximum code difference is just 118%, so the largest programs have got much smaller, suggesting that the ARM standard C libary implementation is the problem.

We now identify some programs where ARM is very much smaller than RISC-V, such as `cubic` (40%) and `frac` (41%). A clue to why this is comes from looking at `matmult-float` (54%) and `matmult-int` (98%).  These are the same program, but one uses floating point arithmetic and the other uses integer arithmetic.  It suggests that ARM might have very efficient maths routines, particularly for floating point.

This could be down to either the maths routines themselves, or since these are integer machines, the floating point emulation code in `libgcc`.

==== Code size without the floating point emulation

We reconfigure to use a dummy C runtime startup function, a dummy standard C library and a dummy floating point emulation.  As with the dummy standard C library, the dummy floating point emulation has functions which either do nothing (if they have a `void` return type) or return constant zero.  They have no dependencies, and because the benchmarks are built using garbage collection of sections only those functions referenced will be included.  This should eliminate all remaining differences that are due to the implementation of the floating point emulation library.

The compile time options add the option `-nostartfiles` to omit the standard C runtime startup, which is replaced by a dummy version and `-nostdlib`, which omits the standard C library and emulation libraries, which are replaced by dummy versions.  For RISC-V the compiler options are as follows.

[source,shell]
----
-Os -march=rv32imc -fdata-sections -ffunction-sections \
-Wl,-gc-sections -nostartfiles -nostdlib
----

And for comparison the following options for ARM

[source,shell]
----
-Os -mcpu=cortex-m4+nofp -mfloat-abi=soft -mthumb \
-fdata-sections -ffunction-sections -Wl,-gc-sections \
-nostartfiles -nostdlib
----

Note that we are still using the standard math library, `libm`.

We see that the sizes are now closer. The programs which previously had the greatest difference, `cubic` (83%) and `frac` (95%) are now much closer in size.  Similarly `matmult-float`(88%) and `matmult-int` (98%) are much closer.

The remaining question is over the impact of the math library implementation.

==== Code size without the standard math library

We reconfigure to use a dummy C runtime startup function, a dummy standard C library, a dummy standard math library and a dummy floating point emulation.  As with the dummy standard C library, the dummy standard math library has functions which either do nothing (if they have a `void` return type) or return constant zero.  They have no dependencies, and because the benchmarks are built using garbage collection of sections only those functions referenced will be included.  This should eliminate all remaining differences that are due to the implementation of the floating point emulation library.

The compile time options are unchanged - the substitute math library is configured for those benchmarks which need it.  For RISC-V the compiler options are as follows.

The change of math library has made little difference. Absolute figures are lower, but the ratios are unchanged. This is perhaps not surprising, since the standard math library is generic compiled C.

|=====================================================================================

With all external factors removed, we can see that on average compiled ARM code is 91% of the size of compiled RISC-V code, when compiled with the standard size minimization options (`-Os` and garbage collection of sections when linking).  This is the basic comparison of the qualify of code compiled to minimize size.

Over 79 benchmarks we found some variation, the best gain for ARM was with the `cubic` benchmark (67%), with the worst loss being `statemate` (118%).  Detailed analysis of the code should prove a fruitful source of optimizations for RISC-V.

We see two system factors which can be addressed.

1. The ARM C runtime startup code is large and pulls in some library functions which may not be needed.  The standard C library implementation (_newlib_) also seems inefficient for ARM, although part of this appears to be due to placing many functions in one object file, causing unneeded code to be linked.

2. The ARM floating point emulation is by comparison blisteringly efficient compared to RISC-V.  Investment in hand-coded assembler floating point emulation would seem to be a quick win.  This comes with the caveat that most deeply embedded applications do not use floating point.  Those that do would tend to specify a hardware floating point unit, rather than using emulation.

==== Next steps

We identify two further steps needed in this analysis.

1. Evaluate the impact of global interprocedural optimization (commonly known as link-time optimization).  Experience suggests this can be a very powerful technique.

2. Investigate in detail those benchmarks for which the largest variation was seen, in order to determine potential optimizations.

==== Section 1--Definitions.

a. *Adapted Material* means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor.

b. *Adapter's License* means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.

c. *BY-SA Compatible License* means a license listed at creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses, approved by Creative Commons as essentially the equivalent of this Public License.

d. *Copyright and Similar Rights* means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.

e. *Effective Technological Measures* means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.

g. *License Elements* means the license attributes listed in the name of a Creative Commons Public License. The License Elements of this Public License are Attribution and ShareAlike.

h. *Licensed Material* means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.

i. *Licensed Rights* means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.

j. *Licensor* means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License.

k. *Share* means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.

l. *Sui Generis Database Rights* means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

m. *You* means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License.  *Your* has a corresponding meaning.

==== Section 2 – Scope

a. *License grant*.
   1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
      A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and
      B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
   2. _Exceptions and Limitations_. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.
   3. _Term_. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).
   4. _Media and formats; technical modifications allowed_. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.
   5. _Downstream recipients_.
      A. _Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material_. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.
      B. _Additional offer from the Licensor – Adapted Material_. Every recipient of Adapted Material from You automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.
      C. _No downstream restrictions_. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.
   6. _No endorsement_. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

b. *Other rights*.
   1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.
   2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.
   3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.


==== Section 3 -- License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
following conditions.

a. *Attribution.*
   1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:
      A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:
      	 i) identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);
	 ii) a copyright notice;
	 iii) a notice that refers to this Public License;
	 iv) a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;
	 v) a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;
      B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
      C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.
   2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.
   3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.

b. *ShareAlike.*  In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.
   1. The Adapter's License You apply must be a Creative Commons license with the same License Elements, this version or later, or a BY-SA Compatible License.
   2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share Adapted Material.
   3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.

==== Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;

b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material, including for purposes of Section 3(b); and

c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.

==== Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.

b. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.

c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.

==== Section 6 -- Term and Termination.

a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.

b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:
   1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or
   2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

c. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.

d. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.

e. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.

==== Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.

a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.

==== Section 8 -- Interpretation.

a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.

b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.

c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.

d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.
